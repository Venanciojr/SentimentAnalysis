# SentimentAnalysis

Overview
The SentimentAnalysis project is a Java-based application designed to analyze tweets' sentiment. The application fetches data from Twitter, processes it, and analyzes the sentiment of the collected tweets. This project leverages basic natural language processing (NLP) principles and provides an easy-to-understand approach to understanding sentiment in textual data.
